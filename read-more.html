      <h3 class="text-md font-bold">Finding My Flow: A Journey Through Learning Styles</h3>
      <p>When I first started high school, I had no idea what a “learning style” even meant. I figured everyone just read their textbooks, memorized facts, and hoped they remembered enough to pass the test. That’s how school had worked for me, and I didn’t question it. But by the end of first year, I realized something had to change.</p>
      <p>Mathematics definately hit me like a truck. I’d stare at the problems for hours, trying to memorize the formulas and diagrams, but come test day, my mind would go blank. Meanwhile, I had friends, family members, family friends who were exceptionally gifted on the subject matter. I was frustrated, confused, and honestly a little embarrassed.</p>
      <p>One day after a rough quiz grade or tri-weeklys as they were called, I had to re-evaluate how I went about understanding the subject.</p>
      <p>“I tend to learn by just jumping in and figuring it out as I go along, which is convinient for the subject because u figure out what you don't know by using what you already know. "I found nothing works better than the motivation of not being a failure. Unfortunately didn't always work.”</p>
      <p>I emphasize on this subject because it's especially a thorne in my existence. Closing out high school I had external examination CSEC/CXC, during the covid and "isolation period" of 2020 and 2021 my study habit's and motivation to learn had taken a nose dive but by the time we were closing into finals I had a handle on all subjects except mathematics.Honestly the peepble in my shoe that just wouldn't go away.</p>
      <p>By the time finals came, I had papers upon papers of past papers that i had done and was ready as i'd ever be for these exams, in all honesty it was a bleak time for me and I was quite sure I would amount to nothing in these exams. Lo an behold I did pass I didnt ace any of my 5 subjects but was by no means a fauilure including mathematics which I was very happy to get a 3.</p>
      <p>All this to say I never believed in learning habits or styles but intrinsic motivation was my biggest factor in recalling anything I had done in the months leading up to those examinations.</p>
      <p>Over the next few years, I refined that discovery. In first year of utech year,the experince was rather dieffrent I was actually studying a subject I quite like it did however sometimes need a physicall rather kinysthetic approach.</p>
      <p>Eventually, I had to tackle more abstract stuff, like algebra and academic literature. kinisthetic learning didn’t always come easy here, but I adapted. For math, it's still a work in progress. For English, I had to write an essay it wwas a combination of all learning styles thaat really helped me see it through, I was able to recall everything I learned wether by reading hearing or personal practice and use into my own paper.</p>
      <p>By second year, I was confident. I knew that for me to learn something, I had to see it. And not just once. I had to break it down, lay it out visually, aconstantly doing it or practic</p>
      <p>College is often described as a time of discovery, growth, and opportunity—but what is rarely emphasized is the weight of the struggle that comes with it. Beneath the surface of lectures, deadlines, and GPAs lies a complex tapestry of self-doubt, exhaustion, and quiet perseverance. Many students enter this chapter with dreams and high expectations, only to be met with the unpredictable storms of late nights, financial strain, mental health battles, and the pressure to constantly perform. There are moments of overwhelming isolation, where it feels like everyone else has it figured out. Days when the finish line seems to drift further away the harder you try to reach it.</p>
      <p>Yet through these challenges, something remarkable happens. You adapt. You find your rhythm. You discover inner reserves of strength you didn’t know existed. The classes you once feared become areas where you grow. The fear of failing turns into the courage to try again. And in the messiness of it all, you evolve—not just as a student, but as a human being learning how to keep showing up for yourself.</p>
      <p>It’s easy to overlook how far you’ve come when you’re still focused on how far you want to go. But every small victory matters. Every paper turned in, every exam completed, every tear wiped away in silence, is proof that you didn’t give up. And that, in itself, is worth celebrating.</p>
      <p>So take a moment. Breathe. Reflect. You may not have it all figured out, and that’s okay. What matters is that you’ve made it this far, through struggles many people will never see or understand. Be proud—not just of the grades you’ve earned, but of the resilience you’ve built. You are living proof that strength is not always loud, but it is always powerful. And your journey, no matter how imperfect, is still uniquely yours—and worth being proud of.</p>
      <p>Taking time to reflect not only on your struggles, but on how you’ve learned through them, is vital. School doesn’t just teach academic concepts—it teaches you how to learn. It teaches you how you learn. Are you someone who thrives through collaboration, or do you discover your best ideas in solitude? Do you understand things better by reading, listening, doing, or teaching others? Recognizing these patterns empowers you to take ownership of your education and use that knowledge far beyond the classroom. It builds confidence—not because you know everything, but because you know how to figure it out.</p>
      <p>Reflection allows growth to take shape. It transforms chaos into clarity. When you understand how you've overcome, how you've adapted and grown, you realize your journey is not just about surviving college—it's about becoming the version of yourself that once only existed in your hopes. And that is something to be truly proud of.</p>
      <p>Now, in my second year of college, I’ve built a flexible learning style toolkit. I still make colorful diagrams, but I also join study groups, use flashcards with audio cues, and teach concepts to friends. I’ve learned that your learning style isn’t a box—it’s more like a set of clothes. Some days you need a warm jacket (visuals), other days a conversation with a friend (auditory), and sometimes, you’ve got to dive in and do the thing yourself (kinesthetic).</p>
      <p>Looking back, I’m grateful for all the struggles. They taught me that learning isn’t just about hard work—it’s about learning how to learn. And once you find your flow, there’s no limit to what you can understand.</p>
