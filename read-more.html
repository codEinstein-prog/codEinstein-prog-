      <h3 class="text-md font-bold">Finding My Flow: A Journey Through Learning Styles</h3>
      <p>When I first started high school, I had no idea what a “learning style” even meant. I figured everyone just read their textbooks, memorized facts, and hoped they remembered enough to pass the test. That’s how school had worked for me, and I didn’t question it. But by the end of first year, I realized something had to change.</p>
      <p>Mathematics definately hit me like a truck. I’d stare at the problems for hours, trying to memorize the formulas and diagrams, but come test day, my mind would go blank. Meanwhile, I had friends, family members, family friends who were exceptionally gifted on the subject matter. I was frustrated, confused, and honestly a little embarrassed.</p>
      <p>One day after a rough quiz grade or tri-weeklys as they were called, I had to re-evaluate how I went about understanding the subject.</p>
      <p>“I tend to learn by just jumping in and figuring it out as I go along, which is convinient for the subject because u figure out what you don't know by using what you already know. "I found nothing works better than the motivation of not being a failure. Unfortunately didn't always work.”</p>
      <p>I emphasize on this subject because it's especially a thorne in my existence. Closing out high school I had external examination csec/cxc, during the covid and "isolation period" of 2020 and 2021 my study habit's and motivation to learn had taken a nose dive but by the time we were closing into finals I had a handle on all subjects except mathematics.Honestly the peepble in my shoe that just wouldn't go away.</p>
      <p>By the time finals came, I had papers upon papers of past papers that i had done and was ready as i'd ever be for these exams, in all honesty it was a bleak time for me and I was quite sure I would amount to nothing in these exams. Lo an behold I did pass I didnt ace any of my 5 subjects but was by no means a fauilure including mathematics which I was very happy to get a 3.</p>
      <p>All this to say I never believed in learning habits or styles but intrinsic motivation was my biggest factor in recalling anything I had done in the months leading up to thos examinations.</p>
      <p>Over the next few years, I refined that discovery. In first year of utech year,the experince was rather dieffrent I was actually studying a subject I quite like it did however sometimes need a physicall rather kinysthetic approach.</p>
      <p>Eventually, I had to tackle more abstract stuff, like algebra and academic literature. kinisthetic learning didn’t always come easy here, but I adapted. For math, it's still a work in progress. For English, I had to right an essay it wwas a combination of all learning styles thaat really helped me see it through, I was able to recall everything I learned wether by reading hearing or personal practice and use into my own paper.</p>
      <p>By senior year, I was confident. I knew that for me to learn something, I had to see it. And not just once. I had to break it down, lay it out visually, and color-code it so it made sense. I even started helping my classmates find their own learning styles. One of them realized they were an auditory learner and started recording lectures. Another discovered she learned best through teaching others.</p>
      <p>College was a whole new level. I went in thinking I had it all figured out. I was ready with my colored pens and highlighters, prepared to conquer every class visually. And at first, it worked. In my psychology class, I drew out the brain and labeled the parts with functions and examples. In statistics, I used graphs and charts to break down data.</p>
      <p>Then came philosophy.</p>
      <p>No diagrams, no neat concepts to map out. Just abstract ideas, long readings, and debates about reality and ethics. I was lost. My visual techniques barely helped.</p>
      <p>That’s when I met Professor Daniels. He saw me struggling and asked how I usually studied. I explained my visual approach, and he nodded.</p>
      <p>“That’s a great start,” he said. “But don’t be afraid to blend styles. Some ideas can’t just be seen—they need to be heard, discussed, experienced.”</p>
      <p>So I tried something new. I joined a study group for the class. We’d talk through concepts and challenge each other’s ideas. I recorded lectures and listened back while walking to class. I even started writing out philosophical arguments like stories, with characters and dialogues.</p>
      <p>It worked. Slowly, the fog lifted. I still used visuals—mind maps of arguments and timelines of philosophical movements—but now I paired them with discussion and writing. I realized I wasn’t just a visual learner. I was a multi-modal learner. Visuals helped me get started, but I needed other tools for deeper understanding.</p>
      <p>Now, in my second year of college, I’ve built a flexible learning style toolkit. I still make colorful diagrams, but I also join study groups, use flashcards with audio cues, and teach concepts to friends. I’ve learned that your learning style isn’t a box—it’s more like a set of clothes. Some days you need a warm jacket (visuals), other days a conversation with a friend (auditory), and sometimes, you’ve got to dive in and do the thing yourself (kinesthetic).</p>
      <p>Looking back, I’m grateful for all the struggles. They taught me that learning isn’t just about hard work—it’s about learning how to learn. And once you find your flow, there’s no limit to what you can understand.</p>
